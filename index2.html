I have rewards in TUBITAK competetions and i also have a running project with my friend group.
We are developing a automation agricultural robot. Also me and my friend qualified to the final
in other tournmament with another friend. Because of the economics we couldn't afford the robot 
price(we studied online and won it online) thats why we decided that to not applying to the 
final. In other hands i play basketball for Mavisehir team. It maintains in U16(under 16 years old)
section for point guard or shooting guard. I have a knowledge of CSS, HTML, C (my main) and a bit of
javascript and java. I have projects about java, CSS , HTML in my github profile. I am also love to 
listening music. My type of music is hard rock or normal rock.
